############################################

This February (2018), the digital agency [Ezoom](http://www.grupoezoom.com.br/ezoom/), from Caxias do Sul, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, got in touch with me to see if I'd like to apply to a job position in their agency.

The test requested was: build an application using [CodeIgniter](http://codeigniter.com), with a basic CRUD - Create, Read, Update and Delete - and at least two tabelas related, like Products and Categories. Good HTML and CSS was a plus. PHP 5.6+ and MySQL 5.5+.

This project is using CodeIgniter 3.1.7.

*******************
Server Requirements
*******************

PHP version 5.6 or newer is recommended.

It should work on 5.3.7 as well, but we strongly advise you NOT to run
such old versions of PHP, because of potential security and performance
issues, as well as missing features.

************
Installation
************

Please see the `installation section <https://codeigniter.com/user_guide/installation/index.html>`_
